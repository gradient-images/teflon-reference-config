# Teflon Reference Configuration

The Teflon Reference Configuration or *refconf* in short is a predefined
configuration directory for the
[Teflon](https://github.com/gradient-images/teflon) post-production framework.
It is developed alongside Teflon itself and we use it as a *proof of concept*
and *documentation* vehicle for the main project. The command `teflon conf -I`
by default will clone this directory from here to initialize a default config
dir.

It is stored in a separate repository to encourage users to fork it and to let
them easily have their own managed version of configuration.

Just like Teflon itself this repository is under heavy development. Expect
frequent and sometimes even radical changes to this. **Please don't use it in
production**, but feel free to play around with it.
